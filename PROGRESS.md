## 🔍 Key Decisions Made

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2025-10-31 | Use Kubernetes cluster 'thor' for deployment | Per instructions - full production deployment |
| 2025-10-31 | Implement dual-tier encryption (E2E + UCE) | Core architectural requirement |
| 2025-10-31 | Mobile-first approach with native apps | Better UX and performance |

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Summary

**Core Innovation:** Dual-tier encryption
- E2E Tier: Maximum privacy, keys never on server
- UCE Tier: Smart features, server-side search, easy recovery

**Platforms:**
1. Backend: API + database + encryption services
2. iOS: Native Swift + SwiftUI app
3. Android: Native Kotlin + Jetpack Compose app
4. Web: Progressive Web App

**Deployment:** Kubernetes cluster 'thor' with proper production setup

---

## 📊 Current Focus

**Today's Priorities:**
1. Make technology stack decisions
2. Initialize GitHub repository structure
3. Set up Kubernetes infrastructure
4. Deploy parallel development agents

**This Week's Goal:**
Complete foundation setup and begin parallel development across all 4 platforms.
