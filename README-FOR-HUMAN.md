# ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for Claude Code

**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Status:** All specifications complete, ready for autonomous development  
**Next Step:** Give START-PROMPT.md to Claude Code

---

## 🎯 What to Do Now

### Give Claude Code This File:

```
/Users/jaystuart/dev/personal-diary/START-PROMPT.md
```

Open that file, copy the entire content (from "# Personal Diary Platform" to "START NOW"), and paste it into Claude Code.

**That's it. Claude Code will handle everything from there.**

- Pull posts from Facebook
- Multi-device sync
- Timeline view

---

## 📊 Quality Standards

Claude Code will ensure:
- ✅ 80%+ test coverage (all components)
- ✅ Zero security vulnerabilities
- ✅ API response time < 200ms (p95)
- ✅ Mobile apps < 2s launch time
- ✅ Web Lighthouse score > 90
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Production-ready code

---

## ⏱️ Expected Timeline

**~10 weeks of autonomous development:**
- Weeks 1-2: Foundation (auth, database, basic UI)
